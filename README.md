# SEVAS
**SEVAS** (**S**ystem of **E**lectronic **V**oting for **A**cademic **S**enate) 
is an open-source project of a complex electronic election system developed 
for Academic Senate in Faculty of Physics, Mathematics and Informatics,
Comenius University in Bratislava (FMPH).

The system provides a handy user interface run in an Internet browser. 
It enables students to cast their votes in elections to the Student Senate 
just using their PCs or smartphones. When voting has ended, the votes are counted 
and the final results are published.

The system ought to be minimal, yet reliable, so that it can run 
in any available Internet browser.
